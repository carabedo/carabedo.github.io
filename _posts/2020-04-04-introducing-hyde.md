Tal vez es mas facil decir que NO es data science.

## Que NO es Data Science?

### You need a Ph.D. in statistics to be a data scientist

No, you don’t. Data science involves crunching numbers to get interesting insights, and it often involves the use of statistics to better understand the results. When it comes to performing some advanced tasks such as machine learning and deep learning, sure, an advanced knowledge of statistics helps. But that does not imply that people who do not have a degree in maths or statistics cannot become expert data scientists.

Today, organizations are facing a severe shortage of data professionals capable of leveraging the data to get useful business insights. This has led to the rise of citizen data scientists – meaning professionals who are not experts in data science, but can use the data science tools and techniques to create efficient data models. These data scientists are no experts in statistics and maths, they just know the tool inside out, ask the right questions, and have the necessary knowledge of turning data into insights.

### No es algo nuevo que esta de moda:

This is probably the most common misconception. Many tend to forget that although ‘data science’ is a recently coined term, this field of study is a cumulation of decades of research and innovation in statistical methodologies and tools. It has been in use since the 1960s or even before – just that the scale at which it was being used then was small. Back in the day, there were no ‘data scientists’, but just statisticians and economists who used the now unknown terms such as ‘data fishing’ or ‘data dredging’. Even the terms ‘data analysis’ and ‘data mining’ only went mainstream in the 1990s, but they were in use way before that period.

Data Science’s rise to fame has coincided with the exponential rise in the amount of data being generated every minute. The need to understand this information and make positive use of it led to an increase in the demand for data science. Now with Big Data and Internet of Things going wild, the rate of data generation and the subsequent need for its analysis will only increase. So if you think data science is a fad that will go away soon, think again.

### No es Business Intelligence:

Business intelligence and data science are often confused, especially by those unfamiliar with the industry. They are not synonymous, however. Business intelligence involves data, yes, but it’s more about the operational and contextual aspects of your organization. Through this process, you answer questions such as what, when, how or who. Learning more about your customers and audience, for example, is one aspect of business intelligence. On the other hand, data science has more to do with predictive analytics. The goal is to collect enough information you can use to build discernible patterns and insights. For example, data science can help you understand why something happened, or when it will happen again. Additionally, data science can answer what will happen if you change various aspects of a process or business plan.

For this reason, data science is more about data mining and statistical or quantitative analysis. It’s also useful for predictive modeling, multivariate testing and process planning. To wrap this point up, don’t get the two concepts confused.

### No es magia:

So many outsiders look at data science as magic, or at the least, some unique form of actual science. Mathematics, statistics, analytics tools — yes, these are all necessary, but data science is more of an art when you get right down to it. Extracting the kind of usable information modern businesses and organizations need takes both skill and talent, and let’s not forget about experience. Implementing machine learning and predictive tools can offset these somewhat, but that doesn’t change the underlying requirements. You still need actual data scientists to do the bulk of the work, who are knowledgeable and experienced with the kind of information specific to your business.

Remember these tips before getting involved, and be sure to do the necessary research. With the right people and knowledge on your side, you’ll be on your way in no time, rocketing to success.


### No es ser un programador:

Yes, there are a lot of data scientists who also understand programming and know how to code and work with computer languages. That said, it does not mean they are experts on a variety of topics. They are essentially the renaissance men and women of the tech industry. Yes, there’s a lot they need to know, but they only focus on one or two of those skills at a time, the most pertinent of which is likely data science and analytics.

The infamous data science Venn diagram teases the idea of an individual who knows how to write code, hack incredibly complex systems, build an efficient machine learning platform from scratch and do the occasional data monitoring and translation on the side. In reality, not all your data scientists are going to be able to do Bayesian methods and code in Java.

Assess what your business needs and what your data calls for before you choose your data scientists based on a wide variety of skills and experience. All data science roles are different, as is everything else listed in that Venn diagram you love so much.
